Tic Tac Toe Java is a simple console-based two-player game built using Core Java. Players take turns placing 'X' and 'O' on a 3×3 grid. The program checks for a win or draw after every move and displays the result. It runs in the terminal and helps beginners practice Java basics like arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input.
